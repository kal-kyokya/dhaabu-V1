# Dhaabu

Dhaabu is an online platform designed to connect Africans living in different countries or regions. The platform fosters a sense of community, provides resources, and creates opportunities for networking, cultural exchange, and collaboration across the continent and the diaspora.

## Inspiration

The idea for Dhaabu was born out of the need to bridge the gaps between Africans living in different parts of the world. While we share a common heritage, our experiences, cultures, and challenges can vary greatly. Dhaabu aims to be a space where these stories and experiences can be shared, celebrated, and supported.
